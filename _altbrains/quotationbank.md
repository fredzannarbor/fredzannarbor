Quotations inspire, provoke, and amuse.  Quotations give us perspective, and remind us of our values.  Quotations expand our world and find us our heroes. Quotations rock!  

Since the Dawn Ages of computing, every new interface has included new ways for readers to consume and share quotations.  In the terminal-driven Unix & Linux world of the 70s & 80s, the canonical tool was the 'fortune' command'.  Easily updated databases captured the collective wisdom of the *nix pioneers and spread their love of perennial cultural monuments such as Tolkien, Twain, and Shakespeare.  Now, Bixby honors the wisdom of the 'fortune' era with a collection of more than 5000 classic unix fortunes.

Additional quotation packs are added on occasion.
