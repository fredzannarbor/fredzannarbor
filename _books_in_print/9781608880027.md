This simple pamphlet, first published in 1944 by the Office of Strategic Services, a predecessor to the CIA, provides inspiring advice on how to sabotage, delay, and impair the progress of work. Rediscovered and declassified, it became a cult favorite in the Intelligence Community in 2008 and was covered extensively in Internet forums such as Boing Boing.
