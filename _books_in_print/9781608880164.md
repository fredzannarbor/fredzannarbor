This case is an essential reference for any author or publisher who is considering the publicati0n of an unauthorized book that complements or comments upon copyrighted material by another author.  In this case, J. K. Rowling and Warner Brothers prevailed against RDR Books, which had published an unauthorized "companion guide" that relied very heavily on "fictional facts" created by J. K. Rowling in the Harry Potter series.
