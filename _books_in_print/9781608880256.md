The submarine and the aircraft carrier were the most important naval innovations and the most decisive naval weapons of the 20th and 21st Century. This comprehensive bibliography prepared at the Naval Postgraduate School covers the less-well-studied submarine side of the equation with information about every major campaign, every major submarine technology, and every navy that wielded submarine technology.  An essential reference for any serious student of naval affairs.
