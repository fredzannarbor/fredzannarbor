A comprehensive historical and international bibliography assembled by the Mine Advisory Committee of the National Research Council in 1974 after the completion of its "Brief History of Mine Warfare."  Mine warfare has played significant roles in most if not all naval wars since the American Civil War and is a topic that deserves careful attention from every serious student of naval history.
