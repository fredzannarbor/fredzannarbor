Professor Barrister thinks he's discovered a new dinosaur species, but third grade dino-experts Nate and Emily aren't so sure. They think his new fossil just looks like an enormous Eoraptor, one of the first dinosaurs ever. To learn who's right they travel back to the Triassic period where they will need to be on the look out for not just dinosaurs, but also the other monstrous predators that lived back at the Dawn of the Dinosaurs!<p>
