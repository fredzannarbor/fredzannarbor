An extremely thorough bibliography of every reference to the torpedo in the holdings of the New York Public Library as of 1917.  This was issued in response to the great public interest in the early successes of the German U-Boats against Allied shipping.  This is an essential reference for those interested in the early history of the torpedo, the torpedo boat, and the submarine. Consider it a "shopping list" for interlibrary loan! Facsimile edition.<p>
