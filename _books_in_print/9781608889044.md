This thesis from the Naval Postgraduate School analyzes the employability of laser weapons on a Navy Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) class ship to counter 
small and fast boat threats. A general model of laser weapons is established to identify the attributes that characterize the laser weapon system. Quantitative values of each attribute are compared with current laser systems (that are under 
development) to identify potential laser types for employment on the Navy ship. In addition, plausible oper
