A beautifully printed keepsake of the only active U.S. Navy warship named after a foreign dignitary, the DDG-81 Winston S. Churchill.  A terrific gift for anyone who loves the navy, warships, World War II, military history, or Churchill. Includes the classic photograph of German destroyer Lutjens rendering honors to DDG-81 on September 14, 2001.
