This memoir provides an eyewitness account of several of the actions of the 1808 Andalusian campaign, culminating in the battle of Ba√≠len and the capitulation of Dupont's entire army. Very little material has hitherto been available in English dealing with this campaign-thus the reader can expect to discover fresh details and new insights not available in the general histories of the Peninsular War.
