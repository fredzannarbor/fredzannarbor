wmctrl is a Linux utility that allows you to list, manage, and move windows and desktops by precise command line instructions rather than clumsy mouse drags.  

Get it by sudo apt install wmctrl.

For a list of active windows,

wmctrl -lG

To move the Bixby window to front and focus,

wmctrl -R Bixby
