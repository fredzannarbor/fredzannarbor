"Last month the global temperature was warmer than any previous January in this data record, although almost on par with January 2016 (at 0.03°C warmer). For Europe, it was the warmest January on record, about 0.2ºC warmer than the previous warmest January in 2007, and 3.1°C warmer than the average January in the period 1981-2010. Average temperatures were especially high over large parts of northeastern Europe, in some areas more than 6°C above the 1981-2010 January average." -- European Commission Climate Bulletin
