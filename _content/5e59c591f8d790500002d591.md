What went well in this sprint: added lots of feature/function, resolved challenging issues.

What went badly / could have been improved:  

* I spent nearly four calendar days on WORKSHOP-125 (sorting outputs from restdb) because I did not understand how the syntax for the bixby httpget query constructor works.   As far as I know, there was no documentation available anywhere in Bixbyland that showed the syntax with worked examples to the necessary level of resolution.  Lessons learned: I could have spent  substantially  less time on fruitless trial and error if I had fully understood the restdb syntax requirements and the httpget syntax. However, I don't think I could have figured the solution out from the existing documentation alone.

* I gave into temptation and released AltBrains Workshop for publication review despite previously resolving to wait on this until March 31.

Most important issues for next iteration:

 * I need a user feedback loop.

* I need an effective marketing funnel to acquire paying customers.

Impediments:

* Bixby ticket 3860 (copy/paste unreliable in Linux)
