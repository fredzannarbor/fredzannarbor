The key accomplishment for this sprint was setting up the MVP metrics and logging that I need to track adoption and usage. 

The metrics that will be my initial focus are:

* number of unique registered users
* number of active AltBrains
* number of requested AltBrains

Logic was added to the program to check whether a user has visited before and, if not, to create a user data record.  

In addition to direct inspection of databases and logs, I also provide an admin panel that provides me with a summary of these key metrics within the capsule -- "dogfooding".
