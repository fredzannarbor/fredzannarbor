What went well:  
* I achieved the core objectives, i.e. capturing my key metrics and dogfooding a way to inspect them.  
* I proved the ability to check database value for bixbyuserid and update accordingly.
* I planned on it being a short sprint and stuck to it.

What went badly/could have gone better:
* I lost three days on struggling with various architectures for new user check.
* A breaking bug in the IDE #4001 appeared on day n-1 of the sprint and prevented me from finishing up the sprint strong and is still not resolved. This reduced the scope.

Issues identified in previous retros and still open:

* User feedback loop will not be available until I begin capturing altbrain requests and addressing them. THis is waiting on Samsung review of capsule version 3.3.10.
* Can't start on marketing funnel until feedback loop is available.  See bullet above.

New issues: 

* Sprint goals with conceptual uncertainty  -- I've never done X before and don't know the recommended path -- tend to soak up a lot of calendar time and cause high stress.  Adding well-understood features is faster and more pleasant.  However, if I only added features that I already understand, I would never address major user experience blockers.
