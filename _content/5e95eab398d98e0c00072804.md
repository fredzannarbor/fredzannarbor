Obama defined the Democratic Presidential brand for 2020 in his concluding words:

The kind of leadership that's guided by knowledge and experience, honesty and humility, empathy and grace -- that kind of leadership doesn't just belong in our state capitols and mayors offices. It belongs in the White House.  And that's why I'm so proud to endorse Joe Biden for President of the United States,
