Wiki: From Dutch verlof (“furlough”), probably from Middle Low German verlōf (“furlough, permission”), from the verb verlōven (“to allow”). From Middle Low German also German Verlaub, Danish forlov.

The word was used from the 1600s as permission granted to a soldier or prisoner asking for leave. The modern usage has involved to include opportunities "granted" by employers to unwilling employees for unpaid time off.

The Tessa Thompson movie involves the traditional sense of the term.
