Informed sources report that OSHA is working on COVID-19 safety recommendations that will put a stake in the heart of the open office strategies.  OSHA document OSHA 3990-03 2020 (the linked PDF) provides some high level Guidance on Preparing
Workplaces for COVID-19.  One key recommendation:

Discourage workers from using other workersâ€™ phones, desks,
offices, or other work tools and equipment, when possible.

That pretty much puts a stake in the open office concepts of hot desking and shared tables.  Everyone gets their own spot!
