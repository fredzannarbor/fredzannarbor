John Bennett of Deepsqualor Springs, TX (?!), or @SpecApe on Twitter, shared this nice observation the other day:

Old words we should use more: mickle.

It's similar to 'very'. Means much or greatly. I learned it from Harvard Lampoon's novel "Bored of the Rings".

"Fearful were the chicken dwarves
But mickle crafty too."

Mickle endorsed.
