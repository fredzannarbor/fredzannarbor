From my film school pal Neil Kramer, who is stranded in a tiny Queens apartment with his mom and his ex-wife. He's been chronicling the experience on Instagram. He's a wonderfully talented photographer and storyteller.

His caption for this image:

 Day 31 of isolation with my mother and ex-wife. We are going crazy. But a beautiful friend from Colorado sent us toilet paper in the mail and we are celebrating and in tears.
