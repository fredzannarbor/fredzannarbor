The pandemic is making it extremely difficult for advocates who are trying to ensure that their communities are properly represented in the 2020 Census, NBC News reports.  

The Census Bureau has extended the collection deadline to October and has asked Congress to extend the congressional reapportionment deadline until April 21.

A pandemic-driven undercount might have a significant drag on Democratic prospects for the 2020s, with no easy opportunity to redress inequities until the next constitutionally mandated census in 2030.
