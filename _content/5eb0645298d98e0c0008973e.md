Former Obama campaign advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe have a better real-world track record for giving advice on winning Presidential campaigns as a Democrat than anyone except Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and they have a clear message for Joe Biden in the May 4th edition of the New York Times: the Force is digital now.  And “Biden in the Basement” is not a strong enough show to hold the audience.

The money quotes:

Adjusting to the new political realities is imperative for Mr. Biden, who ran his first campaign for office a half-century ago. ... Online speeches from his basement won’t cut it. 

The gist of their advice, detailed in the linked article, is this: you need digital help, lots of it, and fast.  Perhaps the most eye-catching recommendation is that "Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and others — should commit two days a week to sharing Mr. Biden’s posts on their own channels on Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms.
