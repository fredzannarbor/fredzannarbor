While humans are highly adaptable and can in principle live in a wide variety of climate niches, in the last 6000 years the largest number of us have been found actually located in a relatively narrow subset of temperate niches with mean annual temperature between 11 and 15C.  Under global warming these niches are moving towards the poles, which means that if no action is taken, an increasing proportion of people will reside in climate niches that historically humans have avoided. To maintain the status quo in terms of the human preference to live in the best available temperature zones, somewhere between 1.5 and 3.5 billion people would have to migrate to new locations by 2070.
