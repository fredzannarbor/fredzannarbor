For my forthcoming book PRESIDENTIAL!, I reviewed all 735 photographs of Joe Biden available in the Defense Visual Information Distribution System (DVIDS). Here is what I learned (or was reminded of...)

Biden likes turtlenecks. 

Biden went to Afghanistan before he was inaugurated the first time. That's doing your job!

Biden and Lindsay Graham were buddies. If Trump is not re-elected, there will be some interesting remarks from Graham.

Biden likes Gatorade.

Biden likes standing really close to people.

The Obamas and the Bidens look nice on stage.

Biden likes SEALS. This was foreshadowing!

He tends to wear the back of his hair too long.
