# Hardcover Formats Added

Ingram, which is the printer and distributor for most Nimble Books, has a promotion going where they will add hardcover format to books that are currently only available in paperback.  This seems to reflects a change in the marketplace where consumers are shifting away from paperback to either hardcover or e-book.  I've taken advantage of this to offer new hardcover versions of some of the better books in the Nimble backlist, including:

- [2030](https://amzn.to/3jriBC9) by Pepe Escobar
- [Blood on Our Hands: the American Invasion and Destruction of Iraq](https://amzn.to/32HgiEg) by Nicolas J.S. Davies
- [In the Shadow of the Battleship: Considering the Cruisers of World War II](https://amzn.to/3jxywPD) by Richard Worth and
- [Dark Navy: The Italian Regia Marina and the Armistice of 8 September 1943](https://amzn.to/2EDFdRf)

This should be revenue positive, I would expect it to increase yearly sales by ~10% per title.
