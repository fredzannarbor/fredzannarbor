# HANDBOOK OF 5GW assigned to a class somewhere

Dan Abbott's [HANDBOOK OF 5GW](https://amzn.to/3mjNuL7) (fifth generation warfare) sold nine units today, a bit of a sales spike! Well deserved! Someone somewhere must have assigned it for a class.  A lot of good essays by smart people.  

Maybe time for the sequel on 6GW?  What would sixth generation warfare be?
