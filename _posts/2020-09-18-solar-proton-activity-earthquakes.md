Scanning over my past feed and reupping [this article from Nature](https://lnkd.in/eMKHsPA) because this didn't get as much news coverage or views as I would have liked.

A dummy's version: it turns out that increased solar activity (proton density) kind of "flexes" the Earth into having earthquakes possibly by causing a piezoelectric effects in deep rock.

Why this matters to me: we didn't even realize until very recently that these huge macro events on Earth were connected to events on the Sun.  We are far more connected to the rest of the Universe than we normally think.
